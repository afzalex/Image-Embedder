# Image-Embedder
The purpose of this software (Image Embedder) was to provide user an easy access to basic information like weather forecasting, reminders, events etc as efficiently as possible. 
The applicationâ€™s code is manageable and scalable and well documented. Suppose a user has installed this application in his computer, then when he start computer he can see the weather forecasting information in desktop wallpaper as if somebody has changed his wallpaper and edited it so that a cool gadget like faded image could be seen over it. In this software, I have used desktop wallpapers to display some common information to the user. A good level of image editing code was written in this application. 
Technologies Used : Google geocode API, Open Weather API, StAX, Java Swing, JNI, Batch file programming.
